# Current Features #
  * Allows dynamic run-time function calls (known as signature scanning).
  * Incredibly easy to use interface.
  * Designed to be as **crash proof** as possible.
  * 100% dynamic. Nothing is hardcoded, meaning if a signature breaks, updating it is as easy as editing an INI file.

# Beta features #
  * Dynamic function detours.
  * Custom type creation, which will allow scripters to call functions in memory that take simple non-standard types (like color32\_s).
