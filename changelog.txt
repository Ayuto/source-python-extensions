============================
VERSION: 1.5.0e
DATE: 1/6/2010
THANKS:

 - (MAJOR THANKS) XE_ManUp
 - The GunGame Development Team
============================

C++-SIDE:
    * Bumped version number
    * Replaced all instances of Warning with DevMsg to prevent ungodly spam.
    * Added a new function called getEntityClassName which should return the classname of a particular entity.
    * Added a new function called getEntityOfIndex which returns the index of an entity (by instance).
    * Replaced all instances of Warning with DevMsg to prevent ungodly spam.

PYTHON-SIDE:
    * Removed __version__ as it's no longer needed.
    * Reorganized all functions to "return None" at the top of the function as opposed to the bottom of the function  to improve readability.
    * Removed "pPlayer = spe.getPlayer(userid)" calls where we never reused the player instance.
    * Removed deprecated functions:
        - entityByInstance()
        - instanceToIndex()
        
    * Updated comment for getIndexOfEntity() to state that it returns "None" instead of "-1" if an invalid index is passed.
    * Optimized several "if...else" statements in various functions by optimizing return value locations.
    * getWeaponDict():
        - Added the key "index" to return the entity's index using spe.getEntityIndex(wPointer).
        - Removed a second function call for spe.ownsWeapon() for the "instance" key. I had already retrieved the instance as "wPointer." Therefore, I used wPointer instead.
        
    * Cleaned up spacing.
    * Redirected instanceToIndex to spe.getEntityIndex.
    * Replaced instances of '== None' with if not.
    
    * Removed unused imports. (import es, from os import name as platform).
    * Added return values to all functions so that scripters can check of successful completion.
    * Added comments to all methods within the functions.
    * Ordered the function calls to return None or False as checks progressed in order to improve readability of the logic.
 
FUNCTIONALITY:
    * Added the following functions to shared.py:
        * getWeaponIndex
        * getWeaponNameList
        * getWeaponInstanceList
        * getWeaponIndexList
        * getWeaponDict
    
    * Added the following functions to cstrike.py:
        * GiveNamedItem
        * DropWeapon

### CODE CHANGES ###
-+ Completely rewrote SPE's internals. Much cleaner.

-+ Rewrote SPE's python API, and documented everything.

-+ Added a new console variable called "spe_engine_ver"

-== POINTERS ARE NOW PASSED AS INTEGERS!
-=== This allows for cool things like comparing pointers directly in python.

### OTHER CHANGES ###
