DATE: 8/27/2009
THANKS:
 - Einlanzers (testing)
============================

### CODE CHANGES ###
-+ Completely rewrote SPE's internals. Much cleaner.
-+ Fixed crash bug when servers would start with a script that used SPE in autoexec.cfg.
-+ Rewrote SPE's python API, and documented everything.

-+ Added a new console variable called "spe_engine_ver"
-++ Returns "ep1" for now, because SPE's rewrite isn't done for OB (yet) ;-)

-== POINTERS ARE NOW PASSED AS INTEGERS!
-=== This allows for cool things like comparing pointers directly in python.

### OTHER CHANGES ###
-+ Ported the .vcproj files to VS2008.

### OTHER NOTES ###
-+ There will be a nice API update coming at some point ;)
